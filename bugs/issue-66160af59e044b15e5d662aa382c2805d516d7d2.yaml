title: Add a way to deal with high pressure cells constrains.
desc: |-
  The purpose of this bug is to take into account
  the possibility to add a constrain on the incomming beam
  and the outgoing beam, for a high pressure cell
  This constrain should be defined by a angle (alpha) and a length (d)
