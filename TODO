Roadmap
-------

* 5.0.0 UNRELEASE
** TODO [hkl] HklEngine "q" -> "qper" and "qpar"
** TODO [hkl] HklAxis degenerated.
   an axis is degenerated if its position have no effect
   on the HklPseudoAxis calculus. Add a degenerated member to the axis.
   that way it would be possible to check a posteriori for this degenerescencence.
** TODO [hkl] HklAxis method to use min/max to check for the validity
** TODO [hkl] HklGeometryList different method to help select a solution.
   this select solution can depend on the geometry
   for example the kappa axis must be in one side of the plane.
** TODO [hkl] add a fit on the Hklaxis offsets.
** TODO [hkl] API to put a detector and a sample on the Geometry.
** TODO [hkl] HklSample add the cell volum computation.
** TODO [hkl] HklEngine "zone"
** TODO [hkl] HklEngine "custom"
		for now this pseudoaxis let you select the axis you
		want to use for the computation.
** TODO [hkl] create a macro to help compare two real the right way
   fabs(a-b) < epsilon * max(1, abs(a), abs(b))
** TODO [hkl] add an hkl_sample_set_lattice_unit()
** TODO [hkl] use the liboil to speed calculation (in HklVector, HklMatrix and HklQuaternion)
** TODO [hkl] SOLEIL SIXS
*** DONE find the right solutions. 				      :zaxis:
    The cosinus and sinus properties are not enough to find the solution expected by the users.
    The idea is to use the Ewalds construction to generate a valid solution from the first one
    obtain numerically. The basic idea is to rotate the hkl vector around the last axis of the
    sample holder until it intersect again the Ewalds sphere. Then we just need to fit the
    detector position. This way the solution can be entirely generic (not geometry specific).
    Nevertheless it is necessary to propose this only for the hkl pseudo axes. I will add this
    special feature in the Mode. So it will be possible to add thoses special cases easily.
*** TODO Add the DEP diffractometer geometry
    This diffractometer is a Newport one based on the kappa 6 circles ones.
    But instead of a kappa head, they use an Hexapod head.
    This head can be put horizontally or vertically.
** TODO [hkl] generalisation of the z-axis hkl solver
   first we need the degenerated member of the Axis. thaht way it could be possible
   to find the last non degenerated axis for the detector fit.
** TODO [hkl] investigate the prigo geometry.
** TODO [ghkl] change the color of fitparameter cells if they differ from the current
	  sample values
** TODO [hkl3d] add a method to find the 3D models in the right directories.
** TODO [packaging] add a .spec file for rpm generation.
** TODO evaluate third-party
*** augeas/elektra for the plugin configure part.
*** REPL https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/tree/master/examples/tutorial
