Roadmap
-------

3.0.0:
	* HklPseudoAxisEngine "q" -> "qper" and "qpar"
	* HklAxis degenerated.
		an axis is degenerated if its position have no effect
		on the HklPseudoAxis calculus.
	* HklAxis method to use min/max to check for the validity
	* HklGeometryList different method to help select a solution.
		this select solution can depend on the geometry
		for example the kappa axis must be in one side of the plane.

3.2.0:
	* add a fit on the Hklaxis offsets.
	* API to put a detector and a sample on the Geometry.
	* HklSample add the cell volum computation.
	* HklPseudoAxisEngine "zone"
	* HklPseudoAxisEngine "custom"
		for now this pseudoaxis let you select the axis you
		want to use for the computation.
