2.3.0   24-01-2007

    * Refactoring of the sample part.
      - It is now possible to create different kind of samples easily.
        - MonoCrystal type.

    * Diffractometers:
      - Eulerian 6 Circles.
      - kappa 4 Circles Vertical.
    
    * Refactoring of the PseudoAxe part.
      - Derived PseudoAxe can be created from an already existing PseudoAxe if the Geometry conversion exist.
      - Better related PseudoAxes (ex Eulerians on a Kappa)
      - The PseudoAxe is just a interface, computation is done by the PseudoAxeEngine.
      - Eulerian 4 Circles Vertical
        - "th2th" : derived from the twoC
        - "q2th" : derived from the twoC
        - "q" : derived from the twoC
      - kappa 4 Circles Vertical
        - "omega", "chi", "phi" : eulerian 4 circles Vertical pseudoAxes.
        - "th2th" : derived from the twoC
        - "q2th" : derived from the twoC
        - "q" : derived from the twoC
        - "psi" : derived from the Eulerian 4 Circlers Vertical.
      - Eulerian 6 Circles:
        - "tth" : 2 * theta
        - "q" : 2 * tau * sin(theta) / lambda
        - "psi" : derived from the Eulerian 4 Circlers Vertical.
      - Kappa6C
        - "omega", "chi", "phi" : derived from the Kappa 4 Circles Vertical.
        - "tth" derived from the Eulerian6C.
        - "q" derived from the Eulerian6C.
        - "psi" : derived from the Eulerian 4 Circlers Vertical.
    
    * Refactoring of the Modes.
      - Derived Mode can be created from an already existing Mode if the Geometry conversion exist.
      - all Eulerian 4 Circles on the kappa4C, Eulerian6c and Kappa6C diffractometers.
